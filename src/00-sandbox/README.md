This is a simple playground to experiment with content for the codelab...

Legit work will evolve into other folders and playground may die off in favor of branching.

### Local Development

We will be working with static files, so you don't need a local webserver,
but if you would like to use one *(for live-reload on file changes)* feel free.

One a simple option is [devd](https://github.com/cortesi/devd)
which is easy to
[install on most OSes](https://github.com/cortesi/devd/releases/tag/v0.8)
*(download and move into your `$PATH`)*.

Then it's as simple as:

```sh
$ cd pathto/00-sandbox
$ devd -ol .
```
