# Google Pay Web Checkout Playground

Use this playground environment to experiment integrating Google Pay, as if you were working directly from your own checkout page.

Google Pay is loaded from your `index.html` file, and once completed, the function `onGooglePayLoaded` in the `index.js` file is called. This is your stating point to integrate Google Pay in this playground.
